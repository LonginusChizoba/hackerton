## My Experience
    -I developed this website as part of a project for devChallenges.io. It allowed me to practice my front-end development skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I utilized Tailwind CSS for styling to streamline the development process and ensure responsiveness across different devices.


## What I learnt
    - I learnt that before starting any project, First try to understand the structure of the project, then map out how to implement it.
    - Made use of flex and grid style to set how the layout of the project will look at each screen.
    - Tailwind Installation and setup.
    - Learnt how to use tailwind CSS for responsive website and tailwind syntax.
    - learnt how to postition an article on top of image and making it resposive for all screen size.
    - Use JavaScript to hide and add interactiveness to the toggle menu.
    - Created a branch on an existing git repository.
    - learnt what .gitignore does and added it to my project.
    - Pushed my project to Github.
    - Deploy to Netlify.

## What I improved on
- Problem-solving Skills: Faced with various challenges during development, I improved my ability to find solutions efficiently, through documentation, online resources, and experimentation.

- Attention to Detail: Paying close attention to design details, ensuring consistency and coherence throughout the website for an enhanced user experience.
