- What was your experience?
    - Find it difficult at first intigrating tailwind css to my html without using using the traditional css am familiar with, because it's my first time using tailwind css for styling. I have to read through the documentation and also when ever i find it difficult to know the syntax to use to a particular styling, i refer back to tailwind doc to search for it. At the end of the project i was able to get the design.
